# JRW
Java Reddit Wrapper is a wrapper for the reddit API, it does not cover all of the API.

Things to know
- it will not cover all of the API rather mainly act as a wrapper to retrive posts and data from subreddits.
- it's recommended to create one instance of the reddit client rather than creating a new one every time since it auto updates the token.
