Java Reddit Wrapper is a wrapper for the reddit API, it does not cover all of the API.

Things to know
- It will not cover all of the API rather mainly act as a wrapper to retrieve posts and data from subreddits.
- It's recommended to create one instance of the reddit client rather than creating a new one every time since it auto updates the token.
- API rate limits are 60 requests / minute.
- I have terrible naming skills.
